# Procedural Observations and Implications

This section captures operationally significant events (SIGACTs) that suggest the need for procedural clarification, training, or coordination practices rather than new system capabilities within the current scope of the system. While these observations reveal breakdowns in coordination or shared understanding, analysis indicates that they are more appropriately addressed through operational procedures, role expectations, or communication norms at this stage.

Including these observations separately helps maintain a clear boundary between system requirements and procedural guidance, while preserving traceability to observed events. The procedures described here are not intended to prescribe detailed standard operating procedures, but rather to highlight areas where explicit coordination practices may reduce the likelihood of similar breakdowns.

It is important to note that this classification reflects the current scope of the system under development. Any of these observations may be revisited and reconsidered as system requirements if the scope is expanded in the future to include additional coordination support capabilities.

| ID | SIGACT | Root Problem (Interpretation) | Procedural Implication |
|----|--------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| S15 | Team queries were ignored due to misidentifying the addressee, communication channel saturation, environmental noise, or individual communication dynamics. | This observation reflects breakdowns in communication discipline and attention management rather than limitations in system functionality. | Teams should establish clear communication protocols, including explicit addressing, acknowledgement practices, and procedures for managing communication under high workload or noisy conditions. |
| S16 | Team communication was hindered when questions or requests did not receive responses, leading to gaps in coordination. | This observation reflects a lack of shared expectations regarding response responsibility and follow-through rather than a system limitation. | Teams should establish procedures ensuring that requests are acknowledged and responded to, including norms for confirming receipt and clarifying unanswered questions. |
| S18 | The Tactical Operator demonstrated uncertainty about what mission or vehicle information the VO/RPIC required during coordination, leading to gaps or delays in information sharing. | This observation reflects a lack of shared expectations regarding what information should be proactively communicated between roles. While procedural in nature, this issue interacts with the capability awareness captured in S17, as improved visibility into roles and information ownership may help operators better understand when to communicate needs. | Operational roles should explicitly communicate their information needs during mission planning or briefings, and establish expectations for what updates should be proactively shared during operations, complementing system support for identifying information sources described in S17. |
| S23–S25  | Procedures shall define which operational role is responsible for initiating transitions out of autonomous mission execution, including conditions under which manual control or end-of-mission actions are taken, and expectations for communicating these decisions across the team.
