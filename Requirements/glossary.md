# Project Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the requirements and analysis artifacts for the MOMUx research project. Definitions are intended to promote consistency and clarity across system, procedural, and experimental discussions.

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Active Control Role | The operational role currently responsible for controlling or directing the aircraft, such as the RPIC, Tactical Operator, or automation. |
| Aircraft Identifier | A unique label or reference used to distinguish a specific aircraft within multi-UAS operations. |
| Autonomous Mission Execution | The period during which the aircraft operates under autonomous control, leveraging onboard sensing, perception, and decision-making capabilities to adaptively plan and execute actions in pursuit of mission objectives without direct manual control. |
| Command-and-Control (C2) | The structure of authority, communication, and responsibility through which operational decisions are made and coordinated among team members. |
| Control State | The current operational mode of the aircraft, such as autonomous execution, manual control, or end-of-mission state. |
| Control Transition | A change in the control state of the aircraft, including transitions from autonomy to manual control or to mission termination modes. |
| Derived Requirement | A requirement that refines or operationalizes a higher-level requirement by specifying additional detail or conditions. |
| End-of-Mission State | A mode entered when active mission execution is terminated or concluding, such as Return-to-Launch (RTL), abort, or landing. |
| Geospatial Representation | Any visual or computational depiction of aircraft position, movement, terrain, or environment, including maps and overlays. |
| Information Ownership | The concept that specific operational roles possess or have access to particular mission or vehicle data. |
| MOMUx Environment | The experimental platform used to study multi-operator multi-UAS supervision, including simulation, instrumentation, and analysis tools. |
| Natural Language Query | An interaction mechanism allowing operators to express information needs using conversational language rather than structured commands. |
| Operational Role | A defined position within the team with specific responsibilities, such as RPIC, Visual Observer, or Tactical Operator. |
| Procedural Requirement | Guidance specifying expected practices, responsibilities, or coordination rules that are addressed through procedures rather than system functionality. |
| Requirement Gap | An identified area where an observed issue has not yet been translated into a concrete requirement and requires further investigation. |
| Requirement Under Investigation | An area identified for further study where appropriate requirements are still being explored through analysis or experimentation. |
| Return-to-Launch (RTL) | An automated behavior in which the aircraft navigates back to a predefined home location, typically used during mission termination or safety events. |
| Role Awareness | Understanding of the responsibilities, capabilities, and information available to different operational roles. |
| Shared Spatial Representation | A common understanding of aircraft position and movement supported by consistent spatial information across interfaces and roles. |
| SIGACT (Operationally Significant Event) | An observed event during operations that reveals a coordination challenge, breakdown, or risk relevant to system or procedural design. |
| Spatial Perspective Alignment | The process of reconciling differences between map orientation, operator viewpoint, and directional references to support accurate reasoning. |
| System Requirement | A statement describing a capability or behavior that the system must provide to support operations. |
| Tactical Operator (TO) | The role responsible for mission monitoring, coordination, and high-level operational oversight. |
| Transactive Memory | Shared understanding within a team of who possesses what knowledge or information, enabling efficient coordination. |
| Visual Observer (VO) | A team member responsible for maintaining visual awareness of aircraft and supporting safe operation. |
