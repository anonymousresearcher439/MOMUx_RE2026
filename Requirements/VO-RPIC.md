## Requirements for VO/RPIC Awareness and Perception

This table contains requirements derived from SIGACTs affecting the Visual Observer (VO) and Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC) roles. The focus is on supporting visual situational awareness, interpretation of drone behavior, and understanding of spatial relationships during supervisory operations. 
| ID | SIGACT | Root Problem | Main Requirement | Derived | NFR Example |
|----|--------|-------------|------------------|---------|-------------|
| S1 | VO/RPIC fail to reacquire drone locations after attentional shift | It is very difficult to track drones in the real world, especially after an attentional shift. Reacquiring their location after a distraction is difficult. Operators require support for rapidly re-establishing awareness of drone location following interruptions or shifts in attention. The system should help operators quickly identify and orient to relevant vehicles without prolonged visual search. While the difficulty was observed following attentional shifts, the underlying need is for operators to rapidly locate vehicles whenever awareness must be re-established. | When requested by the operator, the VO/RPIC interfaces shall provide mechanisms to magnify or otherwise visually emphasize sUAS so that they stand out clearly from the surrounding environment. | The VO/RPIC interfaces shall allow the operator to select one or more active sUAS for magnification or visual emphasis. | Operators shall correctly identify the location of a specified sUAS within T seconds in at least P% of trials when magnification or visual emphasis is used. |
| S2 | VO/RPIC lose visual line-of-sight (VLOS) due to distance or occlusion | The operator is unable to easily track drones that are far away or occluded by obstacles. Operators need to know where these drones are even when they are not naturally visible. | The VO/RPIC interfaces shall provide representations that allow operators to determine the location of sUAS that are not directly visible due to distance, occlusion, or field-of-view limitations. | The VO/RPIC interfaces shall indicate when an sUAS is outside visual line-of-sight or otherwise not directly observable. | Operators shall determine the location of non-visible sUAS within T seconds when queried. |
| S3 | VO/RPIC fail to understand what movements the sUAS are doing | The sUAS perform diverse activities, some of which appear stationary. This is confusing to the operator, who may not know whether the sUAS is stalled, waiting for resources, or actively performing a task. Activity status is available in the Tactical Operator interface but not available to the VO/RPIC. | The VO/RPIC interfaces shall provide information describing the current task or operational activity of each sUAS. | The VO/RPIC interfaces shall present task or activity information in a form that can be readily interpreted during operations. | Operators shall correctly identify the current task or activity of a specified sUAS in at least P% of trials without requiring clarification from the Tactical Operator. |
| S4 | VO/RPIC have difficulty estimating velocity | Operators need to estimate velocity to understand motion and anticipate future position, including potential time to arrival or time to collision. | The VO/RPIC interfaces shall provide information about the velocity and direction of each sUAS. | The VO/RPIC interfaces shall allow operators to select preferred units for velocity information (e.g., mph, m/s, or knots). | Operators shall correctly report the velocity of a specified sUAS without unit-related errors in at least P% of trials. |
| S5 | VO/RPIC lose ability to estimate altitude and discern distance to obstacles (trees, drones) | This SIGACT highlights the broader need for operators to understand spatial relationships, including altitude and proximity to obstacles or other aircraft, in order to anticipate unsafe conditions. | The VO/RPIC interfaces shall provide indications when an sUAS is at risk of collision or unsafe proximity with other aircraft or obstacles. | The VO/RPIC interfaces shall identify the aircraft or obstacle involved in a potential collision or proximity condition. | Operators shall correctly recognize potential collision conditions in at least P% of trials. |
