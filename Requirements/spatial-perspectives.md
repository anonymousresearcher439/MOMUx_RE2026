## Geospatial Understanding and Representation Alignment Requirements

This section captures requirements derived from SIGACTs that reveal challenges in understanding and aligning spatial information across different representations, such as maps, planned flight paths, and real-world observations. These SIGACTs highlight situations where operators must mentally translate between representations or manually manipulate artifacts to relate planned trajectories to what they observe in the environment.

The requirements focus on supporting operators in reasoning about aircraft position, movement, and adherence to planned routes by ensuring that spatial information can be interpreted in a way that aligns with their viewpoint and supports accurate judgment. The goal is to reduce cognitive burden associated with mental rotation or frame translation and to enable operators to confidently determine whether sUAS are behaving as expected.

Each entry documents the observed issue, an interpretation of the underlying spatial reasoning challenge, a main requirement, a derived requirement that refines or supports the capability, and an example non-functional requirement with a measurable outcome.

| ID | SIGACT | Root Problem | Main Requirement | Derived | NFR Example |
|----|--------|-------------|------------------|---------|-------------|
| S9 | VO/RPIC fail to find spatiotemporal support by looking at a given 2D printed path map, leading to confusion about whether sUAS are on course | Operators struggled to relate the planned flight paths shown on a static 2D printed map to the real-world environment, often physically rotating or repositioning the map in an attempt to align it with their viewpoint. This reflects a lack of support for translating between representations and aligning planned trajectories with observed aircraft positions, leading to uncertainty about whether sUAS were following their intended routes. | The VO/RPIC interfaces shall support operators in relating planned flight paths to the real-world positions of sUAS during operations. | Information about planned paths and aircraft position shall be presented in a manner that aligns with the operator’s viewpoint of the real-world scene. | Operators shall correctly determine whether a specified sUAS is following its planned route using available spatial information in at least P% of trials. |
| S10 |TO loses perception of sUAS closeness in 2D view when two sUAS are horizontally proximate but vertically separated. | The 2D display flattened three-dimensional spatial relationships and did not adequately convey vertical separation, leading the Tactical Operator to misinterpret aircraft proximity. Without clear cues to differentiate altitude or depth, overlapping icons were perceived as close, resulting in incorrect collision concerns. | The Tactical Operator interfaces shall support accurate interpretation of spatial relationships, including vertical separation, between sUAS represented in two-dimensional displays. | Representations of sUAS shall provide cues that allow operators to distinguish relative separation in three-dimensional space. | Operators shall correctly determine whether specified sUAS are in close proximity or safely separated in at least P% of trials. |
| S19/S20 | Altitude information communicated between the Tactical Operator and VO/RPIC used different reference frames (e.g., above sea level versus above ground level), creating confusion and making it difficult for team members to interpret altitude during coordination. | Differences in altitude reference frames create cognitive translation burdens, requiring operators to mentally convert values to understand operational meaning. Inconsistent representations can lead to misinterpretation of vehicle state or safety margins and disrupt shared situational awareness. | The system shall ensure that a single altitude reference frame is used consistently across all interfaces and operational communications during a mission. | The system shall clearly indicate the active mission altitude reference frame. | In mission scenarios requiring altitude interpretation, operators shall correctly interpret communicated altitude relative to the active mission reference frame in at least P% of trials (P ≥ 99%). |
