# Alert Management Requirements

This page captures requirements related to how system alerts are generated, presented, interpreted, and shared among operational roles during mission execution. These requirements address observed breakdowns in alert detection, alert overload, identity attribution, and team awareness of anomalous system conditions.

Alerts play a critical role in supporting safe and effective supervision of autonomous operations by signaling conditions that may require attention or intervention. The requirements in this section focus on ensuring that alerts are salient, interpretable, and visible so that operators can recognize and respond to important events without being overwhelmed or misled.

| IDs | SIGACT Description | Root Problem | Main Requirement | Derived Requirement | Fit Criterion |
|-----|--------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| S26–S30 | RPIC failed to notice alerts, experienced alert saturation, and did not consistently communicate alert information to the team. Alerts were sometimes not clearly attributable to a specific aircraft, and other roles lacked visibility into alert conditions, leading to delayed or incomplete shared awareness of system anomalies. | These observations reflect breakdowns in alert detectability, cognitive load management, identity attribution, and team-wide awareness. Alerts must be salient, interpretable, and shared so that critical system conditions are recognized and acted upon without overloading operators. | The system shall support effective detection, interpretation, and shared awareness of alerts across operational roles during mission execution. | Alerts shall be clearly distinguishable from other system sounds or notifications so operators can recognize them as alerts. | Operators shall correctly detect alerts within T seconds in at least P% of alert scenarios. |
| S26–S30 | Same as above | Same as above | The system shall support effective detection, interpretation, and shared awareness of alerts across operational roles during mission execution. | The system shall support operators in managing alert load so that important alerts can be attended to during high workload periods. | Operators shall respond appropriately to high-priority alerts without missing critical alerts in at least P% of high workload scenarios. |
| S26–S30 | Same as above | Same as above | The system shall support effective detection, interpretation, and shared awareness of alerts across operational roles during mission execution. | Alerts shall clearly indicate the associated aircraft to avoid confusion about which sUAS is affected. | Operators shall correctly identify the affected aircraft in at least P% of alert scenarios. |
