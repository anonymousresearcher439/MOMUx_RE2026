# Alert Management Requirements

This page captures requirements related to how system alerts are generated, presented, interpreted, and shared among operational roles during mission execution. These requirements address observed breakdowns in alert detectability, alert overload, alert attribution, and the ability of operators to understand the meaning and significance of alerts.

Alerts play a critical role in supporting safe and effective supervision of autonomous operations by signaling conditions that may require attention or intervention. The requirements in this section focus on ensuring that alerts are salient, interpretable, credible, and visible so that operators can recognize, understand, and respond appropriately to important events without being overwhelmed or misled.

| IDs | SIGACT Description | Root Problem | Main Requirement | Derived Requirement | Fit Criterion |
|-----|--------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| S26 | RPIC failed to notice system alerts due to focus on primary monitoring tasks and inability to recognize alert sounds, leaving anomalies undetected. | Alerts were insufficiently salient or distinguishable, making it difficult for operators to recognize when a condition required attention. | R1. The system shall ensure that alerts are clearly perceivable so operators can reliably detect when anomalous conditions occur. | R2. Alerts shall be distinguishable from other notifications and recognizable as alerts during mission operations. | R3. Operators shall correctly detect alerts within T seconds in at least P% of alert scenarios. |
| S27 | RPIC experienced alarm fatigue and cognitive saturation due to a high frequency of alerts during safety-critical phases, resulting in missed or delayed responses. | Excessive alert frequency can overwhelm operators, reducing their ability to attend to critical alerts and increasing risk during high workload periods. | R4. The system shall support management of alert load to reduce cognitive saturation during mission operations. | R5. The system shall support prioritization or differentiation of alerts so operators can focus on the most critical conditions during high workload periods. | R6. Operators shall respond appropriately to high-priority alerts without missing critical alerts in at least P% of high workload scenarios. |
| S28–S30 | Alerts were not consistently communicated to the team, were internally acknowledged without sharing, or lacked clear aircraft identity, leading to confusion about which sUAS was affected and delayed team awareness. | Alerts did not reliably support shared understanding across roles, particularly regarding which aircraft was affected and whether others were aware of the condition. | R7. The system shall support shared awareness of alerts across operational roles during mission execution. | R8. Alerts shall clearly indicate the affected aircraft and be visible to relevant operational roles so awareness does not depend solely on verbal communication. | R9. Relevant operational roles shall correctly identify active alerts and the affected aircraft in at least P% of trials. |
| S33, S34 | The team exhibited normalization of system alerts due to unclear reasons for alerts and the absence of observable abnormalities, leading operators to discount or ignore alerts. | Alerts that do not convey clear cause or significance can lose credibility over time, leading operators to normalize or disregard them and increasing the risk that true anomalies will be missed. | R10. The system shall support operators in understanding the reason and operational significance of alerts during mission operations. | R11. Alerts shall convey sufficient context or rationale to help operators interpret why the alert was triggered and assess its relevance. | R12. Operators shall correctly interpret the meaning and operational significance of alerts in at least P% of evaluated scenarios. |
