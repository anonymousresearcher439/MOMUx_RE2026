| SIGACT | Short Description | Category |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| S1 | VO/RPIC fail to reacquire drone locations after attentional shift | |
| S2 | VO/RPIC lose visual line-of-sight due to distance or occlusion |  |
| S3 | VO/RPIC fail to understand what movements or activities sUAS are performing | |
| S4 | VO/RPIC have difficulty estimating velocity | |
| S5 | VO/RPIC lose ability to estimate altitude and proximity to obstacles |  |
| S6 | VO/RPIC lose target discrimination due to distance | |
| S7 | VO/RPIC have to constantly confirm sUAS and mission status with TO to maintain situational awareness | |
| S8 | VO/RPIC shift attention to GUI and lose continuous visual monitoring ||
| S9 | VO/RPIC fail to find spatiotemporal support from 2D printed path map | |
| S10 | TO loses perception of sUAS closeness in 2D view when vertically separated | |
| S11 | Operators lacked awareness of autonomous system intent or planned behavior during operations. | Intent Awareness and Behavior Understanding |
| S12 | Operators were uncertain whether aircraft were following planned trajectories or deviating from expected paths. | Intent Awareness and Behavior Understanding |
| S13 | Operators misclassified normal behavior as abnormal or lacked clear cues to interpret system-reported abnormal conditions. | Intent Awareness and Behavior Understanding |
| S14 | Operators either assumed manual control for behavior later determined to be normal or hesitated to intervene due to insufficient confidence or data to confirm concerns. | Intent Awareness and Behavior Understanding |
| S17 | VO/RPIC were unaware of the Tactical Operator’s GUI capabilities and available data streams, leading to confusion about where relevant mission or vehicle information could be obtained during coordination. | Team Coordination |
| S18 | TO was unsure what information VO/RPIC needed, reflecting a breakdown in shared understanding of information needs. | Procedural Observations and Implications |
| S19 | Incompatible altitude reference frames created confusion in interpreting aircraft altitude across roles. | Geospatial Understanding and Representation Alignment |
| S20 | Use of different altitude reference frames across roles led to difficulty interpreting altitude information consistently. | Geospatial Understanding and Representation Alignment |
| S21 | Cardinal-based telemetry and map views did not align with operator perspective, leading to discrepancies in spatial understanding. | Geospatial Understanding and Representation Alignment |
| S22 | Different location estimates between roles created discrepancies in shared spatial understanding. | Geospatial Understanding and Representation Alignment |
| S23 | Command-and-control hierarchy collapsed when roles issued conflicting or unclear authority regarding manual override. | Team Coordination |
| S24 | Operators engaged in permission-seeking loops regarding manual override decisions, reflecting unclear authority or decision criteria. | Team Coordination |
| S25 | Control decisions were not consistently communicated across roles, leading to uncertainty about aircraft control state. | Team Coordination |
| S26 | RPIC failed to notice system alerts due to competing attention demands. | Alert Management |
| S27 | RPIC experienced alert saturation due to high alert frequency during critical phases. | Alert Management |
| S28 | Alerts were internally acknowledged but not communicated to the team. | Alert Management |
| S29 | Operators failed to communicate the correct aircraft identity associated with alerts. | Alert Management |
| S30 | Tactical Operator did not know which aircraft an alert referred to. | Alert Management |
| S31 | Team failed to notice abnormal aircraft behavior until a formal alert occurred. | Intent Awareness and Behavior Understanding (maps to S12, S13) |
| S32 | Team hesitated to take manual override due to insufficient confidence or data to confirm concerns. | Intent Awareness and Behavior Understanding (maps to S14) |
| S34 | Team normalized alerts due to unclear reasons or lack of observable abnormality. | Alert Management |
